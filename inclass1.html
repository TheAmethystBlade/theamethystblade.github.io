      <h2>About Him</h2>
        <p>Captain Falcon (キャプテン・ファルコン, Captain Falcon), full name Douglas Jay Falcon,[citation needed] and somethimes shortened as C. Falcon, is the main playable racer from the F-Zero series of futuristic Nintendo racing games and is the mascot of the franchise. As a member of the "perfect-attendance crew", Captain Falcon has been featured as a playable character throughout the entire Super Smash Bros. series. His highly offensive playstyle, his signature moves (most notably his Falcon Punch) and his memorable quotes have made him a fan favorite character across the Super Smash Bros. series despite F-Zero's status as a lesser-known Nintendo franchise. His voice actor throughout the Super Smash Bros. series is Ryō Horikawa.</p>
        <p>Nintendo originally meant for Captain Falcon to be the flagship character of the then-new Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[3] However, this never panned out, and Captain Falcon was instead relegated to being the mascot of F-Zero.</p>
	<p>F-Zero was released in 1990 for the Super Famicom in Japan and its western counterpart, the SNES. It introduced the first character design of Captain Falcon along with the other three F-Zero series characters that appeared in the game as racing pilots, along with their respective futuristic racing machines, such as Captain Falcon's Blue Falcon. The manual to the game featured an eight-page comic featuring these characters, with the comic's story revolving around one of Falcon's trademark bounty-hunting missions in his Falcon Flyer transport ship. Captain Falcon's design and backstory would be revised in future iterations of the F-Zero series; his design in F-Zero X for Nintendo 64 would be used for his appearances as a playable fighter in 1999's Super Smash Bros. and 2001's Super Smash Bros. Melee, and his most recent "main" design is in F-Zero GX for GameCube. In all these appearances, Captain Falcon and his machine are touted as the most balanced and easy-to-play-with machine for that game, so players of a new F-Zero game almost always play as Captain Falcon first. He is also known as the game's main character.</p>
